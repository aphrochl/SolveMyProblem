## Project Overview

This project implements **Simply Solved**, a microservices-based platform designed to manage user-submitted problems, automatically solve them, and handle payments and statistics. The application follows a full-stack implementation with separate services for core functionalities, communication through REST APIs, and Docker-based orchestration.

Key features:
- **Backend microservices**: Several microservices, including user management, problem handling, solution generation, payments, and statistics, each running as an independent service. 
- **API Gateway**: A reverse proxy that routes requests from the frontend to the appropriate backend microservices.
- **Problem submission and solving**: Users can submit problems, which are automatically processed and solved by the system.
- **Payment handling**: The platform manages transactions related to user credits and balances.
- **Statistics and analytics**: Extraction of detailed usage metrics and performance statistics based on user-submitted problems and solutions.
- **Dockerized architecture**: The system is fully containerized, making it easy to deploy and scale.
- **Version control and project management**: GitHub is used for source code management, version control, and project tracking.
